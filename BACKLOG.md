# Backlog

This file tracks outstanding tasks and feature ideas for the project. Items are recorded here so contributors can coordinate on upcoming work.

## Items

1. **Document module3 differences**
   - Write a comprehensive explanation comparing `module3.py` and `module3-gem.py`.
   - Outline additional fields such as `rating` and `improvement_suggestions` introduced in `module3-gem.py`.
   - Highlight the modified logging setup in `module3-gem.py` with its verbose logger compared to the single logger used in `module3.py`.
   - Note that downstream modules may require updates to consume these new fields.
